title: "Affiliate Fees"
description: "Learn how to implement affiliate fees to earn revenue from Garden swaps through your integration"
---

Garden allows partners to charge an affiliate fee for each swap initiated through their SDK or API integration. This fee must be specified when requesting a quote and is charged in addition to protocol and solver fees.

<Info>
  Fees are expressed in basis points (bps), where 1 bps = 0.01%. For example, a
  30 bps fee equals 0.3% of the source asset value.
</Info>

Affiliates can earn rewards in USDC or cbBTC on [supported chains](/developers/supported-chains). Fees can be sent entirely to a single address in one asset, or split across multiple addresses and assets.

For example, a 30 bps fee could be split by sending 10 bps in USDC to an Ethereum address, and 20 bps in cbBTC to a Base address.

<Note>
  The amount of each asset the affiliate will receive is calculated based on
  prices at the time of the quote and is also stored in the order data. All
  affiliate fees collected during the week are distributed to the specified
  addresses at the end of the week.
</Note>

## Implementation

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Using API">
        To apply an affiliate fee via API, include the `affiliate_fee` parameter when requesting a quote:

        ```shell
        curl -X 'GET' \
        'https://testnet.api.garden.finance/quote/?order_pair=<order_pair>&amount=<amount>&exact_out=<true/false>&affiliate_fee=30' \
        -H 'accept: application/json'
        ```

        In this example, we've added a 30 bps affiliate fee.

        To include affiliate fees, add the `affiliate_fees` field when **creating an order**.

        Here's a sample create order request:

        ```shell
        curl -X 'POST' \
        'https://testnet.api.garden.finance/relayer/create-order' \
        -H 'accept: application/json' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
            "source_chain": "<source_chain>",
            "destination_chain": "<destination_chain>",
            "source_asset": "<source_asset>",
            "destination_asset": "<destination_asset>",

            "timelock": "<timelock>",
            "secret_hash": null,
            "affiliate_fees": [
            {
                "address": "<affiliate_address_1>",
                "chain": "<chain_1>",
                "asset": "<asset_1>",
                "fee": <affiliate_fee_1>
            },
            {
                "address": "<affiliate_address_2>",
                "chain": "<chain_2>",
                "asset": "<asset_2>",
                "fee": <affiliate_fee_2>
            }
            ],
            "additional_data": {
            "strategy_id": "<strategy_id>",
            "bitcoin_optional_recipient": "<user_bitcoin_address>"
            }
        }'
        ```

        <Note>
            Refer to the [Supported assets](/developers/supported-chains) to find the asset addresses of USDC and cbBTC. Check out the full implementation using API [here](/api-reference/quickstart).

    <Tab title="Using SDK">
        This process involves two steps:

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Request Quote">
                Requesting a quote with the affiliate fee applied
            </Step>
            <Step title="Attest and Submit">
                Attesting the quote and submitting the order
            </Step>
        </Steps>

        To request a quote with an affiliate fee, include the `affiliateFee` parameter in the `options` object.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```ts React
            import { SupportedAssets } from "@gardenfi/orderbook";
            import { useGarden } from "@gardenfi/react-hooks";

            const { swapAndInitiate, getQuote } = useGarden();

            const fromAsset = SupportedAssets.testnet.ethereum_sepolia_WBTC;
            const toAsset = SupportedAssets.testnet.arbitrum_sepolia_WBTC;
            const amount = 100000;
            const isExactOut = false;

            const quoteRes = await getQuote({
                fromAsset,
                toAsset,
                amount,
                isExactOut,
                options: {
                    affiliateFee: 10 // in bps
                },
            });
            ```
            ```ts NodeJS
            const orderpair = 'ethereum_sepolia:0x29C9C37D0Fec7E64AFab0f806c8049d9e2f9B0b6::arbitrum_sepolia:0x795Dcb58d1cd4789169D5F938Ea05E17ecEB68cA'
            const amount = 100000
            const isExactOut = false

            const quoteRes = await garden.quote.getQuote(
                orderpair,
                amount,
                isExactOut,
                {
                    affiliateFee: 10, // in bps
                },
            );
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        While creating the order using the `swap` function, you can include the `affiliateFee` property to specify the recipient addresses, the fee amounts (in bps), and optionally the assets and chains you want the payout to be in. Garden supports payout in USDC and cbBTC.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```ts React
            const [_strategyId, quoteAmount] = Object.entries(quoteRes.val.quotes)[0];
            const response = await swapAndInitiate({
                fromAsset,
                toAsset,
                sendAmount: amount.toString(),
                receiveAmount: quoteAmount,
                additionalData: {
                    strategyId: _strategyId,
                },
                affiliateFee: [
                    {
                        address: "<affiliate_address_1>",
                        chain: "<chain_1>",
                        asset: "<asset_1>",
                        fee: 10
                    },
                    // Add more splits as needed
                ]
            });
            ```
            ```ts Node.js
            const [_strategyId, quoteAmount] = Object.entries(quoteRes.val.quotes)[0];
            const swapParams: SwapParams = {
                fromAsset,
                toAsset,
                sendAmount,
                receiveAmount: quoteAmount,
                additionalData: {
                    strategyId: _strategyId,
                },
                affiliateFee:[
                    {

                        chain: "<chain_1>",
                        asset: "<asset_1>",
                        fee: 10
                    },
                    // Add more splits as needed
                ]
            };

            const swapResult = await garden.swap(swapParams);
