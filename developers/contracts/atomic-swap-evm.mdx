## Contract Architecture

HTLCs on EVM chains use smart contracts to implement the atomic swap functionality. The contract manages the lifecycle of a swap through four main operations:


<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Initiate" icon="play" href="/developers/contracts/atomic-swap-evm#initiate">
    Lock funds in the contract with a secret hash and timelock
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redeem" icon="check" href="/developers/contracts/atomic-swap-evm#redeem">
    Claim funds by revealing the secret that matches the hash
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refund" icon="rotate-left" href="#refund">
    Reclaim funds after the timelock expires
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Refund" icon="bolt" href="#instant-refund">
    Cancel the swap with mutual agreement from both parties
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Functions

### Initiate

The initiate function creates a new HTLC by locking tokens in the contract. It requires:

- **Secret Hash**: SHA256 hash of a secret known only to the initiator
- **Timelock**: Block number after which refund is possible
- **Redeemer Address**: Address authorized to claim the funds
- **Token Amount**: Amount of tokens to lock

```solidity
function initiate(
    bytes32 secretHash,
    uint256 timelock,
    address redeemer,
    uint256 amount
) external payable;
```

<Note>
**EVM Advantage**: The function interface makes it easy to integrate with existing Solidity tooling and provides clear input validation.
</Note>

### Redeem

The redeem function allows the redeemer to claim the locked tokens by providing the secret that hashes to the stored secret hash.

```solidity
function redeem(
    bytes32 swapId,
    bytes32 secret
) external;
```

<Info>
The secret must hash to the exact value stored during initiation. Once revealed, this secret enables the counterparty to claim funds on the other chain.
</Info>

### Refund

The refund function allows the initiator to reclaim their tokens after the timelock has expired and the redeemer has not claimed the funds.

```solidity
function refund(bytes32 swapId) external;
```

<Note>
**EVM Advantage**: Uses absolute block numbers for timelock, which can be more predictable than Bitcoin's relative timelock mechanism.
</Note>

### Instant Refund

The instant refund function provides a way for both parties to mutually agree to cancel the swap before the timelock expires.

```solidity
function instantRefund(
    bytes32 swapId,
    bytes memory initiatorSignature,
    bytes memory redeemerSignature
) external;
```

## EVM-Specific Features

### State Management

The contract tracks each swap's state through an enumeration - a feature not available in Bitcoin scripts:

```solidity
enum SwapState {
    INVALID,    // Swap doesn't exist
    OPEN,       // Funds locked, awaiting redemption
    REDEEMED,   // Secret revealed, funds claimed
    REFUNDED    // Timelock expired, funds returned
}
```

### Event Logging

The contract emits events for each state transition to enable efficient off-chain monitoring:

```solidity
event SwapInitiated(bytes32 indexed swapId, address indexed initiator, address indexed redeemer);
event SwapRedeemed(bytes32 indexed swapId, bytes32 secret);
event SwapRefunded(bytes32 indexed swapId);
event SwapInstantRefunded(bytes32 indexed swapId);
```
