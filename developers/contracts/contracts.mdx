Atomic swaps enable secure cross-chain transactions using **Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs)**. These contracts ensure that either both parties complete the swap or both get their funds back - no party can be cheated.

### Universal Concepts

Regardless of the blockchain, all atomic swap implementations share these core methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Initiate" icon="play">
    Lock funds in the contract with a secret hash and timelock
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redeem" icon="check">
    Claim funds by revealing the secret that matches the hash
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refund" icon="rotate-left">
    Reclaim funds after the timelock expires
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Refund" icon="bolt">
    Cancel the swap with mutual agreement from both parties
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Security Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Universal Compatibility">
    Any chain that supports Sha256 hashing and Relative TimeLocks can be added to Garden.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timelock Safety">
    Funds can always be recovered if the counterparty doesn't participate within the specified timeframe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Authorization">
    Only designated parties can claim funds, preventing unauthorized access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Atomic Execution">
    The swap either completes fully on both chains or fails completely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Cross-Chain Coordination

The secret revealed when redeeming on one chain can be used to claim funds on the other chain. This creates the atomic property:

1. **Initiator** locks funds on Chain A with secret hash
2. **Redeemer** locks funds on Chain B with the same secret hash  
3. **Initiator** redeems on Chain B by revealing the secret
4. **Redeemer** uses the revealed secret to claim funds on Chain A

<Info>
Both implementations use the same cryptographic primitives and security model, but differ in their execution environments and technical approaches.

## Implementation-Specific Details

### EVM Implementation

<Card title="Atomic Swap (EVM)" href="/developers/contracts/atomic-swap-evm" icon="ethereum">
  **Smart Contract Model**: Uses Solidity contracts with state management  
  **Execution**: Function-based interface with gas-metered execution  
  **Timelock**: Absolute block numbers for expiry  
  **Events**: On-chain event logging for state transitions  
  **Authentication**: Ethereum addresses and ECDSA signatures
</Card>

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contract state stored on-chain with enums
- Function calls modify contract state
- Events emitted for off-chain monitoring
- Absolute timelock using block numbers
- Account-based model

### Bitcoin Implementation

<Card title="Atomic Swap (BTC)" href="/developers/contracts/atomic-swap-btc" icon="bitcoin">
  **Script Model**: Uses Bitcoin Script with stack-based execution  
  **Execution**: Transaction-based with OP codes  
  **Timelock**: Relative time with CheckSequenceVerify  
  **Monitoring**: Transaction-based state tracking  
  **Authentication**: X-only pubkeys (Taproot) and Schnorr signatures
</Card>

**Key Characteristics:**
- Scripts executed per transaction
- Stack-based execution model
- Relative timelock using CSV
- UTXO-based model
- No persistent state storage

## Technical Comparison

| Aspect | EVM | Bitcoin |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Execution Model** | Smart contracts | Scripts |
| **State Management** | On-chain storage | Transaction-based |
| **Timelock Type** | Absolute (block numbers) | Relative (CSV) |
| **Authentication** | Ethereum addresses | X-only pubkeys |
| **Monitoring** | Events | Transaction parsing |
| **Programming Model** | Function calls | Stack operations |

<Note>
Despite different technical approaches, both implementations achieve identical security guarantees and atomic properties. The choice between them depends on the specific blockchain being used.
