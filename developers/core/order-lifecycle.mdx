description: "Understanding the various states an order can go through during the swap process"
---

Understanding the lifecycle of an order is critical for developers integrating with Garden protocol. This page outlines the various states an order (or [intent](/home/fundamentals/introduction/intents)) can go through during the swap process, helping you manage integration logic effectively. For a high-level explanation of the order flow, refer to the [intent flow](/home/fundamentals/how-it-works/intent-flow).

An order's lifecycle starts when a user creates an intent to swap assets and continues through matching, execution, and final settlement. Each stage is tracked programmatically using the `OrderStatus` and `SwapStatus` enums. To track the current status of an order, refer to [SDK documentation](/developers/sdk/sdk) for SDK implementations or [API Reference](/api-reference/quickstart) for API-based integrations.

## Order states

The tables below classify all the order statuses, providing descriptions and the corresponding actions. The **Actions** column is particularly useful for API integrators, detailing the steps they need to implement for each state. For SDK implementations, these actions are already handled, so the information serves as a reference to understand the underlying process.

### Order creation and matching

| Status | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`Created`** | The order is created and waiting for a solver to match. | -- |
| **`Matched`** | A solver has matched the order. | The user has to initiate the transaction on their source chain. |

### Settlement: User and solver execution

| Status | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`InitiateDetected`** | The user's initiation transaction is detected on-chain but not confirmed yet. | -- |
| **`Initiated`** | The user's initiation is confirmed. The solver must now initiate the transaction on the destination chain. | Wait for the solver to initiate. |
| **`CounterPartyInitiateDetected`** | The solver's initiation transaction is detected on-chain but not confirmed. | -- |
| **`CounterPartyInitiated`** | The solver's initiation is confirmed, and the user must redeem their funds on the destination chain. | The user has to redeem their funds. |

### Redemption and completion

| Status | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`RedeemDetected`** | The user's redeem transaction is detected on-chain but not confirmed yet. | -- |
| **`Redeemed`** | The user has redeemed their funds. The solver will now redeem their funds on the source chain. | -- |
| **`CounterPartyRedeemDetected`** | The solver's redeem transaction is detected on-chain but not confirmed. | -- |
| **`CounterPartyRedeemed`** / **`Completed`** | The solver has redeemed their funds, marking the entire order as completed. | -- |

### Exceptional and failure states

| Status | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`CounterPartySwapExpired`** | The solver's [HTLC](/home/fundamentals/introduction/atomic-swaps) has expired. | The user must wait for their HTLC to expire to claim a refund. |
| **`Expired`** | The user's HTLC has expired. | The user has to refund their funds. |
| **`RefundDetected`** | The user's refund transaction is detected on-chain but not confirmed. | -- |
| **`Refunded`** | The user's refund is confirmed, and they have reclaimed their funds. | -- |
| **`DeadLineExceeded`** | 1. Initiate transaction is not detected within 1 hour. 2. Initiate transaction is not confirmed within 12 hours. | -- |

## Swap states

Each swap (user or solver side) transitions through the following states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`Idle`** | The swap is not yet initiated. |
| **`InitiateDetected`** | Initiation transaction is detected but not confirmed. |
| **`Initiated`** | The initiation transaction is confirmed. |
| **`RedeemDetected`** | Redemption transaction is detected but not confirmed. |
| **`Redeemed`** | Redemption transaction is confirmed. |
| **`RefundDetected`** | Refund transaction is detected but not confirmed. |
| **`Refunded`** | Refund transaction is confirmed. |
| **`Expired`** | The swap expired, and a refund is required. |

## Status flow diagram

<Note>
The order progresses through these states sequentially, with some states allowing for parallel execution between user and solver actions.
</Note>

Understanding these states is crucial for:
- **Error handling**: Knowing when to retry operations or escalate issues
- **User experience**: Providing accurate status updates to users
- **Integration logic**: Implementing appropriate actions based on current state
- **Debugging**: Identifying where issues occur in the swap process
