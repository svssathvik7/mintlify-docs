Localnet testing is a crucial step in ensuring your Garden SDK integration works as intended before deploying it to a testnet or mainnet. To support your testing, we provide **Merry**, an in-house tool designed for comprehensive cross-chain testing in a local environment.

Merry is a CLI tool that leverages Docker to set up a multi-chain testing environment with a single command. It includes:

- **Bitcoin regtest node:** A local Bitcoin testnet environment.
- **EVM localnet nodes:** Local Ethereum and Arbitrum test environments. Simply add the localnet details to your EVM wallet to detect and interact.
- **Filler bot:** Simulates the behavior of a live [solver](/home/fundamentals/introduction/solvers) based on predefined strategies.
- **Orderbook:** Local version of the [order book](/home/fundamentals/introduction/auctions) to test how intents are matched and fulfilled.
- **Faucet:** Generate unlimited test funds for seamless testing.
- **Electrum services:** Lightweight wallet support for interacting with Bitcoin network.

Merry eliminates block mining delays, provides a complete environment for multi-chain workflows, and allows developers to test integrations independently of external services. Itâ€™s customizable, fast, and supports iterative testing with features like local service replacement. 

## Installation

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker is installed and running. Download Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com).
</Info>

Merry supports arm64 and amd64 architectures. For Windows, use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Run these scripts based on your environment.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Linux & MacOS
# Run the following command to install Merry:
curl https://get.merry.dev | bash
```

```bash Windows
# In a WSL terminal, run sudo dockerd and verify if the docker daemon is running, then:
curl https://get.merry.dev | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

Merry stores its configuration and other data in a `.merry` directory on your system.

## Commands

Merry provides a variety of commands to manage your testing environment.

### Start Merry

Start all services with:

```bash
merry go
```

<Accordion title="Optional flags">
- `--bare`: Starts multi-chain services only (Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes with explorers) without Garden services
- `--headless`: Starts all services without frontend interfaces for server environments
</Accordion>

### Stop Merry

Stops all running services:

```bash
merry stop
```

<Tip>
Use `--delete` or `-d` to remove data:
```bash
merry stop -d
```
</Tip>

### List all commands

Display all available commands:
```bash
merry --help
```

### Get logs

Access logs for specific [services](#supported-services):
```bash
merry logs -s <service>
```

Replace `<service>` with the specific service (e.g., filler, orderbook) to view its logs.

```bash
# Example: Get EVM logs
merry logs -s evm
```

### Replace a service with local version

Replace a service with your local development version:
```bash
merry replace <service>
```

<Warning>
Make sure you're in the directory containing the local service's Dockerfile. You can only replace filler, orderbook, and EVM chain services.
</Warning>

### Interact with Bitcoin RPC

Run Bitcoin RPC [commands](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) directly:
```bash
merry rpc <method> <params>
```

Example - get blockchain info:
```bash
merry rpc getblockchaininfo
```

### Fund accounts

Use the faucet to fund Bitcoin or Ethereum addresses for testing:
```bash
merry faucet --to <address>
```

### Update Docker images

Keep your environment up-to-date by pulling the latest Docker images:
```bash
merry update
```

### Generate auto-completion scripts

Generate scripts for your shell (bash, zsh, fish, powershell):
```bash
merry completion <shell>
```

### Get version info

Check the version of Merry installed:
```bash
merry version
```

## Supported services

<Note>
The following services are available when running Merry. Use these ports to connect your applications and tools.
