---

Garden was built with the vision of enabling Bitcoin in DeFi as seamlessly as possible. To achieve this, we've designed Garden to be easy to integrate into any wallet, aggregator, or dApp, empowering developers to unlock Bitcoin's potential in their products.

## What does Garden unlock?

Traditionally, cross-chain flows require users to manually bridge their Bitcoin before using those funds in dApps. Garden simplifies this with an SDK and API that abstracts the bridging process, letting users directly utilize Bitcoin within DeFi ecosystems. Here's what Garden can enable:

## Choosing between SDK and API

Choosing between Garden's SDK and API depends on your project's requirements:

### SDK

Garden SDK is a customizable API wrapper tailored for React and Node-based dApps. It simplifies integration with a plug-and-play approach, requiring minimal setup. This is ideal for developers seeking a quick and efficient way to integrate Bitcoin swaps with minimal setup. Check out the quick start guides for [React](/developers/sdk/react/quickstart) and [Node](/developers/sdk/nodejs/quickstart) to get an understanding.

### API

Garden APIs are designed for broader application environments, such as wallets, mobile apps, or implementations in Rust, Go, or other programming languages. While highly flexible, it requires more development effort, making it perfect for advanced workflows. Begin with exploring the [API](/api-reference/quickstart).
