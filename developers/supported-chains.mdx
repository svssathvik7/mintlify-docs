import {SupportedAssets, AssetRow, ASSETS_URL, MAINNET_ASSETS_URL, TESTNET_ASSETS_URL, getAssets, trimAssetName, getExplorerUrl, CHAIN_EXPLORERS, titilize} from "/snippets/supported-assets.jsx";

Garden uses the following contracts to perform swaps on respective chains:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Mainnet">
        <SupportedAssets key={MAINNET_ASSETS_URL} url={MAINNET_ASSETS_URL}/>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Testnet">
        <SupportedAssets key={TESTNET_ASSETS_URL} url={TESTNET_ASSETS_URL}/>
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
    If you would like to see a chain or asset that isn't listed here, reach out to us in the [Townhall](https://discord.gg/dZwSjh9922).
