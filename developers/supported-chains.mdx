import {mainnetSupportedAssetsConfig, testnetSupportedAssetsConfig, SupportedAssets, AssetRow} from "/snippets/supported-assets.jsx";

Garden uses the following contracts to perform swaps on respective chains in the mainnet environment:
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Mainnet">
        <SupportedAssets supportedAssetsConfig={mainnetSupportedAssetsConfig}/>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Testnet">
        <SupportedAssets supportedAssetsConfig={testnetSupportedAssetsConfig}/>
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
