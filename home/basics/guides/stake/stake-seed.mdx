Participate in the Garden protocol by staking [SEED](/home/governance/tokenomics). Staking unlocks revenue sharing and [governance](/home/governance/governance-process) power for you. If you are new, you can buy SEED [here](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=arbitrum&inputCurrency=NATIVE&outputCurrency=0x86f65121804d2cdbef79f9f072d4e0c2eebabc08). This guide explains the staking process and the options available to you.
