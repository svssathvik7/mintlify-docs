Convert your Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) back to native Bitcoin. This process "unwraps" your WBTC from Ethereum or Arbitrum networks and returns it as native Bitcoin.

<Info>
This guide covers swapping **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)** to **Bitcoin (BTC)**. The process typically completes in under 30 seconds.

## What You'll Need

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wallets">
    - **EVM Wallet**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or other EVM-compatible wallet with WBTC
    - **Bitcoin Wallet**: Optional (you can provide a Bitcoin address manually)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assets">
    - WBTC tokens on Ethereum or Arbitrum
    - Small amount of ETH or ARB for gas fees to approve the transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 1: With Bitcoin Wallet Connected (Recommended)

    2. Click **Connect Wallet** and connect your **EVM wallet** containing WBTC

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Swap Details">
    1. Review the conversion details:

       - **Network fees**: Gas fees for the EVM transaction
       - **Garden fees**: Protocol fees for the swap
       - **Receiving address**: Your connected Bitcoin wallet address
    2. Click **Swap** when ready to proceed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve Transaction">
    1. Your EVM wallet will prompt you to approve the WBTC transfer
    2. Confirm the transaction and pay the gas fees

## Method 2: Manual Bitcoin Address

If you prefer not to connect your Bitcoin wallet, you can provide a Bitcoin address manually.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect EVM Wallet Only">
    1. Visit [Garden Finance](https://app.garden.finance)
    2. Connect your **EVM wallet** containing WBTC
    3. Skip connecting a Bitcoin wallet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Bitcoin Address">
    1. In the **Receive** section, select **Bitcoin (BTC)**
    2. Manually enter your **Bitcoin receiving address**
    3. **Double-check this address** - incorrect addresses cannot be recovered
    4. Ensure the address is from a wallet you control
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the Swap">
    1. Configure the swap amount and review details
    2. Click **Swap** and approve the WBTC transaction in your EVM wallet
    3. Wait for the transaction confirmation and swap completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security & Safety

<Info>
**Atomic Swaps**: Garden uses atomic swap technology, meaning the transaction either completes entirely or fails entirely. Your WBTC is never at risk of being lost without receiving Bitcoin.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Address Verification**: Always double-check your Bitcoin receiving address. Garden cannot recover funds sent to incorrect addresses.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Network Confirmation**: Bitcoin transactions require blockchain confirmations. While Garden's process is fast, final Bitcoin confirmation may take 10-60 minutes depending on network conditions.
</Note>

## Fees and Costs

| Fee Type | Description | Typical Amount |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Gas Fees** | EVM network transaction costs | Varies by network congestion |
| **Garden Protocol Fee** | Service fee for atomic swap | Small percentage |
| **Network Spread** | Market-based pricing difference | Usually minimal |

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Pending
- **Check gas fees**: Ensure you've set adequate gas prices
- **Network congestion**: Wait for network conditions to improve
- **Wallet issues**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallets

### Incorrect Amount Received
- **Slippage**: Market prices may change during transaction
- **Fees**: Final amount reflects deducted fees
- **Contact support**: Join Discord for assistance if amounts seem incorrect

## After Your Swap

Once you receive your Bitcoin:

- **Verify Receipt**: Check that Bitcoin arrived in your specified wallet
- **Security**: Consider moving Bitcoin to cold storage if not actively trading
