# How to Swap WBTC Cross-Chain

Move your Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) between different blockchain networks. Garden Finance enables seamless cross-chain transfers without requiring you to unwrap to Bitcoin first.

<Info>
This guide covers transferring **WBTC between different networks** such as Ethereum to Arbitrum, Arbitrum to Ethereum, or to other supported chains. The process typically completes in under 30 seconds.
</Info>

## Supported Networks

Garden Finance supports WBTC on multiple networks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ethereum" icon="ethereum">
    **Mainnet WBTC**  
    Most established with highest liquidity  
    Higher gas fees but maximum DeFi compatibility
  </Card>
  <Card title="Arbitrum" icon="triangle">
    **Layer 2 WBTC**  
    Lower fees and faster transactions  
    Growing DeFi ecosystem
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What You'll Need

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wallet Requirements">
    - **EVM Wallet**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or other EVM-compatible wallet
    - **Source Network**: WBTC on the blockchain you're moving from
    - **Destination Network**: Gas tokens for the destination network (if needed)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Assets">
    - WBTC tokens on the source network
    - Gas fees for transaction approval (ETH on Ethereum, ARB on Arbitrum)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Cross-Chain Routes

### Ethereum to Arbitrum

Moving WBTC from Ethereum to Arbitrum for lower transaction costs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    1. Visit [Garden Finance](https://app.garden.finance)
    2. Connect your EVM wallet containing Ethereum WBTC
    3. Ensure your wallet is connected to Ethereum network
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Cross-Chain Swap">
    1. **Send Section**: Select **WBTC on Ethereum**
    2. **Receive Section**: Select **WBTC on Arbitrum**
    3. Enter the amount you want to transfer
    4. The interface will show you the receiving address (same as your sending address on different network)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Transfer Details">
    - **Source**: WBTC on Ethereum
    - **Destination**: WBTC on Arbitrum  
    - **Rate**: Should be approximately 1:1 (minus fees)
    - **Gas Cost**: Ethereum gas fees for approval
    - **Completion Time**: Usually under 30 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Transfer">
    1. Click **Swap** to initiate the transfer
    2. Approve the WBTC transaction in your wallet
    3. Pay the Ethereum gas fees
    4. Monitor progress on the Garden interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Receipt">
    1. Switch your wallet to Arbitrum network
    2. Check that WBTC appears in your wallet on Arbitrum
    3. You can now use WBTC in Arbitrum DeFi protocols
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Arbitrum to Ethereum

Moving WBTC from Arbitrum back to Ethereum mainnet.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup">
    1. Connect your wallet to Garden Finance
    2. Switch your wallet to Arbitrum network
    3. Ensure you have WBTC on Arbitrum and enough ARB for gas
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Reverse Swap">
    1. **Send**: WBTC on Arbitrum
    2. **Receive**: WBTC on Ethereum
    3. Enter transfer amount
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Transfer">
    1. Approve the transaction (low Arbitrum gas fees)
    2. Wait for completion
    3. Switch wallet to Ethereum to see received WBTC
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Move WBTC Cross-Chain?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Optimization" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Lower Fees**: Move to Arbitrum for cheaper DeFi transactions  
    **Batch Operations**: Perform multiple operations on L2 then return to mainnet
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ecosystem Access" icon="network-wired">
    **Different DeFi Protocols**: Access unique opportunities on each network  
    **Liquidity Arbitrage**: Take advantage of price differences between chains
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Network Comparison

| Aspect | Ethereum | Arbitrum |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Gas Fees** | High during congestion | Very low |
| **Transaction Speed** | 12-15 seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| **DeFi Ecosystem** | Most mature | Growing rapidly |
| **Security** | Highest (Layer 1) | Inherits Ethereum security |
| **WBTC Liquidity** | Highest | Good and growing |

## Advanced Strategies

### DeFi Arbitrage
1. **Monitor Rates**: Watch for rate differences between networks
2. **Move Capital**: Transfer WBTC to the network with better opportunities
3. **Execute Strategy**: Participate in farming, lending, or trading
4. **Return Profits**: Move gains back to preferred network

### Cost Management
1. **Batch Transactions**: Accumulate transactions on Arbitrum
2. **Strategic Timing**: Move during low Ethereum gas periods
3. **Fee Planning**: Consider gas costs in your profit calculations

## Security Considerations

<Info>
**Same Address**: Your WBTC will appear at the same wallet address on the destination network. Garden's atomic swaps ensure safe cross-chain transfers.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Network Verification**: Always verify you're on the correct network before initiating transfers. Sending to wrong networks may result in permanent loss.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Gas Requirements**: Ensure you have gas tokens on both source and destination networks for optimal experience.
</Note>

## Fees and Timing

### Fee Structure
- **Source Network Gas**: Pay gas on the network you're sending from
- **Garden Protocol Fee**: Small percentage for the cross-chain service  
- **No Double Bridge Fees**: Direct cross-chain transfer without multiple bridge hops

### Timing Expectations
- **Approval**: Immediate wallet confirmation
- **Processing**: 30 seconds typical completion time
- **Finality**: Near-instant availability on destination network

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Transaction Stuck
- **Check Network**: Ensure wallet is on correct source network
- **Gas Price**: Increase gas price if transaction is pending
- **Cancel & Retry**: Cancel stuck transaction and retry with higher gas

### Wrong Network
- **Prevention**: Double-check network selection before confirming
- **Recovery**: If sent to wrong network, contact Garden support immediately
- **Verification**: Always verify destination network in Garden interface

### Insufficient Balance
- **Gas Tokens**: Ensure you have ETH (Ethereum) or ARB (Arbitrum) for gas
- **WBTC Balance**: Verify you have enough WBTC plus a small buffer for precision
- **Fee Reserve**: Keep some gas tokens for future transactions

## After Your Cross-Chain Transfer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Receipt">
    Switch your wallet to the destination network and confirm WBTC arrival
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Portfolio">
    Your portfolio trackers should reflect the new network location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Opportunities">
    Research DeFi protocols available on your new network
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Popular Use Cases

### Moving to Arbitrum
- **DeFi Farming**: Lower fees for yield farming strategies
- **Active Trading**: Cheaper transactions for frequent trading
- **Experimentation**: Test strategies with lower gas costs

### Moving to Ethereum
- **Blue-Chip DeFi**: Access to most established protocols
- **Maximum Liquidity**: Largest liquidity pools and trading volume
- **New Protocol Access**: Many protocols launch on Ethereum first
