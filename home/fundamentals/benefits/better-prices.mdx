title: "Better Prices"
description: "Learn how Garden delivers competitive pricing with potential for improvement during execution"

Traditional bridges often rely on AMMs to facilitate swaps, exposing users to slippage based on the depth of the liquidity pools. This is especially inefficient for swaps between likewise assets, such as BTC and WBTC or cbBTC.

Garden's intents-based architecture removes this inefficiency. [Solvers](/home/fundamentals/introduction/solvers) maintain flexibility in their quotes and compete to fulfill user intents using on-chain and off-chain liquidity.

Users not only get a competitive price at the time of swap initiation but also have the potential to settle at better prices. By leveraging peer-to-peer matching, and advanced settlement mechanisms like [xCoW](/home/fundamentals/how-it-works/cross-chain-coincidence-of-wants-xcow), Garden dynamically optimizes swaps during execution.

<Tip>
When users initiate a swap, they are shown a minimum guaranteed quote. During settlement, however, Garden's price improvement capabilities can unlock better pricing.
