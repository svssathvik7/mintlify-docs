    - Manages and oversees the Snapshot space.
    - Maintains the integrity of the governance process.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Voting power

Voting power in Garden is determined by staking [multipliers](/home/fundamentals/introduction/stakers) and ownership of the Gardener Pass NFT. Stakers gain increased voting power based on their staking multiplier, which rewards long-term commitment to the protocol. Additionally, Gardener Pass NFT holders receive a fixed voting power of 70 votes.
