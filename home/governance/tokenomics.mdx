SEED is the utility token of Garden and is designed to facilitate participation in the protocol. The token launched on [January 18th, 2024](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x02446e6d65cef97f2a172382179c035bf5cd5738dfc1ba3c01c7f8a8439ec00d).

SEED empowers holders to actively shape the Garden ecosystem:

- **Staking**: [Stake](/home/fundamentals/introduction/stakers) SEED to participate in protocol governance and earn a share of platform revenue. A minimum of 2,100 SEED are required to stake.
- **Market making**: Holding 210,000 SEED tokens grants eligibility to become a [solver](/home/fundamentals/introduction/solvers).
- **Governance**: Participate in protocol decision-making, have a say in selecting community incentive programs, giving grants, and treasury allocation.
- **Mint and burn**: You can choose to permanently burn 21,000 SEED (perma-stake) to mint a [Gardener pass](/home/governance/gardener-pass). This pass comes with all the benefits of permanently staking seed, and also gives you the flexibility to transfer ownership to a different wallet or put it up for sale as its an NFT.
- **Exclusive access**: SEED holders receive early access to new features, exclusive contests, and other benefits, enriching their engagement within the Garden ecosystem.

## Emission schedule

<Note>
*As of January 21, 2025*
</Note>

### Community incentives

The community incentives allocation accounts for **96 million SEED**, designed to drive ecosystem growth through grants, campaigns, and other initiatives.

- **Distributed to date:** 12.44 million SEED (12.96%), of which 3.78 million SEED have been permanently staked.
- **Remaining funds:** Controlled by the DAO, which determines their use through the governance process.

### Team and investor incentives

The team and investor incentives allocation account for **51 million SEED**. Both investors and the team have a **24-month cliff** starting from TGE (January 18, 2024). Post-cliff, SEED tokens are streamed over a multi-year schedule as outlined below. This predictable and fair distribution model aligns with the protocol's long-term goals.

- **Investor incentives** are streamed over a 24-month period following the cliff.
- **Team incentives** are streamed over a 30-month period following the cliff.

## Future Outlook

The SEED allocation for community incentives is dynamic, with the DAO determining its distribution to ensure alignment with community needs. Transparent tokenomics and governance-driven decisions will remain central as Garden evolves. Initiatives to onboard new chief gardeners and enhance community engagement will expand in future phases of the protocol.
